A/B Testing on User Retention in a Mobile Game
In this project, I conducted an A/B test analysis for the popular mobile game Cookie Cats. The test evaluated the impact of shifting the first in-game time gate from level 30 to level 40 on player behavior and retention. The goal was to optimize user experience while balancing monetization opportunities. Using real gameplay data, I applied statistical methods such as normality checks, variance homogeneity, and independent t-tests to assess whether the change led to significant differences in user progression. The analysis was performed using Python with libraries including pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, and scipy. Findings provided actionable insights to support data-driven game design and monetization strategies.
